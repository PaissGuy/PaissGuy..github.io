                I made this website to present my web-developing skills. I have no experience outside of the univerity as a web developer but I'm a very fast learner who can learn complex topics and get things donein a very short time. For example,
                the development of this website took a few days of developing while writing my thesis. By hiring a junior worker, espacially one who has proven to be able to study, you can have in just a few
                weeks a full fledge experienced worker in my opinion.
