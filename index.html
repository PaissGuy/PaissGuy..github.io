                I made this website to present my web-developing skills. I will point out that as of today I have zero experience in web developing in the market, But I made this website in a couple of dayswhile I was working on my thesis.
                For some reason I'll admit I can't understand, many companies are spending alot of effort publishing their companies to attract experienced workers, while
                ignoring the many junior workers that are for hired. By hiring a junior worker, espacially one who has proven to be able to study, you can have in just a few
                weeks a full fledge experienced worker in my opinion.
