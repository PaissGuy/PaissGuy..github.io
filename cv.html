                Graduated from Tel Aviv University with a dual BSc degree in computer science and chemistry at part of the army "atuda".  
                I served my mandatory military service and was discharged with excellence after three years.  
                I am currently working on my master's research (last semester) in optoelectronics at Professor Ori Cheshnovski's research group in the Chemistry Department.  
                My research involved semiconductors and their characterization by optical means (Super Continuum Lasers). I am looking for a full-time position that utilizes my skills.
